    Growing up, I&apos;ve always had a passion to learn how anything related to technology works - whether 
    hardware or software. Initially, it began with my passion for creating designs and user interfaces. Then my curious
    mind wanted to bring those designs to life, so I started off by learning HTML & CSS.

    Fascinated with how intricate programming can be, I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I moved on to learn javascript and then discovered the amazing things that 
            could be done using React JS. Now I spend my time building projects with React JS, Next JS, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and a bunch of other technologies.
